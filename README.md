# Curation dashboard

## TODO

* add proper instructions for starting up etc (the solid css of shapes) -> development
* Clean up inrupt stuff
* add lint
* go to drawing board on what is need for dashboard of curation
  * How to configure
  * Default configuration
  * View announcements in a list
* Add buttons for creating view announcement, dcat-dataset announcement and dcat-dataservice announcement (in different component that can be removed)
* Synchronizing acts strange when doing it twice (DC-issued not properly being added) maybe due to caching?
